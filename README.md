# covid

Introduction<br>
 In the covid_1 notebook, I demonstrated reading file from web, renaming columns, merge, concatenate and saving data in csv format.<br><br> 
 In the Covid_EDA, I used different EDA techniques mostly visualisation (maps, bar graph)  to explore the covid dataset in more detail. 
<br> 


Dataset:  <br>
Data were taken from [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) github page. <br>
For this demonstration I took  confirmed_US,   confirmed_global, (iii) death_US, (iv) death_global,and (v) recovered_global <br> csv file. <br>
